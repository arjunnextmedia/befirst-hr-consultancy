                                <p>
                                    Employer branding is the perception people have about your company as a workplace ‚Äî not just for potential hires, 
                                    but also for your existing team. For SMEs in Kerala, this matters because:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Talent is scarce ‚Äî skilled professionals have plenty of options.</li>
                                    <li>Employee turnover is costly ‚Äî replacing staff drains time and resources.</li>
                                    <li>Local competition is increasing ‚Äî other businesses are targeting the same talent pool.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>A strong employer brand builds trust, loyalty, and excitement about working for your company.</p>
